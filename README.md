## Setting Up API Token
You will need to go to https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app and create a app which will then give you a api token you will put into the home.mycroft.ai settings page for this skill.

The zip code is not required, if you don't put a zip code in it will use the location from the mycroft home settings.

## Setting up IFTTT Webhook for Text
In order to get the text messages when you ask `send info` we need to setup IFTTT webhook.

Follow [This](https://ifttt.com/create) link to setup a Webhook.  You will want to create a New Applet and select Webhook

1. Click the +this blue icon and select webhook.
2. Select the option "Receive a web request"
3. Put `mycroft_yelp` as the name of the event.
4. Select +that and select sms
5. Select send me a sms
6. Put the following as the message - `{{Value1}} Star Rating: {{Value2}} {{Value3}}`
7. Select create action
8. Hit finish on the next screen.
9. Now go to https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks and select the Documentation section.
10. This will give you a URL that you will want to put in the home settings under the IFTTT URL section in order to receive the text messages. **Please note the {event} part of the URL is replaced with mycroft_yelp**
11. Now the skill should be able to send text messages when you say `send info`

## Screenshot Example
Here is what from the Mycroft CLI the response looks like currently, plans to have this come with all the info including the address and such as a text message using IFTTT webhooks.
